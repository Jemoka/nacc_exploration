############ Correlation Study ############ 

# For each feature of interest, we perform a
# one-way chi-square test for choorelation. Note about the
# P-values here: the null hypothesis is that the
# two groups are INDEPENDENT, so a small p-value is desired
# here.
# 
# Therefore, we hope that groups 1, 8, and 0 are significantly
# different in terms of mean in that variable.
#
# We perform chi-square here because most of the input data can be broken
# down into categories to analyze (they are (mostly) not continuous)
# if they are continuous, we will integer quantize it
#
# Furthermore, we create two results with and without ignoring
# naccalzd = 8 because impaired vs. AD is a /very/ different problem
# than normal limits vs. AD
